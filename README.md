Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

•	My website  contains four 4 html pages:
1.	index.html
2.	pastmovies.html
3.	moviestop10.html
4.	underconstruction.html
and it is possible to get from any page to any other page by following the return to home page hypelink.
•	My website contains many unordered lists,one table in moviestop10.html and a background image(same background image for all pages).
•	My website has two  stylesheet files:
1.	moviestop10.css
2.	pastmovies.css
Also it contains two scss files:
1.	_master.css
2.	myindex.scss

•	My stylesheets use more than five CSS properties.
1.	 padding
2.	margin
3.	font
4.	colo,
5.	border
6.	background 
 And more than  five different types of CSS selectors
1.	element element( in index.html in line 91)
2.	element > element(in my index.scss in line 11)
3.	element.class(in pastmovies.css in line 86)
4.	.class(in myindex.scss in line 3)
5.	#id(in myindex.scss in line 67)
I have at least four ids as you can see in myindex.scss.(#one,#two,#three,#four)
I also have at least three classes as you can see in myindex.scss.(.here-1,.here-2,.here-3)
•	I have many media queries in all my css files.
All the html files are mobile responsive and something about them changes as the screen becomes smaller.
•	I use bootstrap for my return to homepage button and in my pastmovies.html  I use col-lg from Bootstrap grid model for layout purposes.
•	I use $box-color in _master.scss,I use SCSS nesting in myndex.scss in lines 28-34 and SCSS inheritance in lines 54,59,64.
